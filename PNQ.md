#### Notes

A random wire antenna seems to be very noisy. In PNQ, I found that the 792 KHz
AIR frequency is repeated all over the HF spectrum. I have read that a magnetic
loop antenna is a much better antenna for filtering out unwanted frequencies.

Update: See [SWL notes](SWL.md) for information on getting better reception
from the same random wire antenna.
