#### Equipment

* RTL-SDR Blog V.3. Dongle

* Polycab 2.5 sq. mm. stranded wire (> 30 meters, random wire antenna)

* Nooelec - Balun One Nine - Tiny Low-Cost 1:9 HF Antenna Balun

* Nooelec - Male SMA to Male SMA cable

* Gqrx SDR software on Ubuntu. Use `rtl=0,direct_samp=2` in the `Configure I/O devices -> Device string` setting.


#### Notes


* In real life, even with just one random wire, adding a Balun One Nine results
  in more signal on HF, and if you connect two equal length random wires to
  both hole, an even better signal.

  Note: Two wires of unequal length also work.
