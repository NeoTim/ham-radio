#### Part list for a HF dipole antenna

I plan to make a 40m + 20m fan dipole antenna.

* Make `end insulator` from Schedule 80 PVC pipe - 2 .5 to 3 inches inches
  long, as thick + strong walls as possible. Small diameter, if possible.
  Alternate: Dog bone insulator / antenna end insulator from Radio Kart online
  shop.

* Center Insulator -> Homebrew using 3D printing.

* 14 gauge single core / stranded copper wire. This is equal to 2.5 sq. mm. Get
  a 90 meters Polycab stranded wire bundle.

* RG-213 for feedline. Get a hundred meter bundle from Spectra Cable.

* SO-239 connectors. Normal one + chasis mount one.

* Schedule 80 - 2 inch PVC pipe - 20 feet -> for building a mast for inverted-v antenna.

* Flat top dipole: Two metal masts (GI pipe) for building opposite ends. PVC
  mast for center mast. 10 feet length pipes should work. Ground length < 75
  feet for 40 feet.

* Things for clamping the pipe / pole to the side wall. Get a fabricator for it.

* Use 550 paracord for tying wires. 1.8mm size to 4mm size.

* Weld multiple hooks to the GI pipe. For PVC pipe, attach the center insulator
  to the top of the PVC pipe. Bring the feedline down from inside the PVC pipe.

* One center insulators is enough for both 40m and for 20m.

* Fix a hook/pulley to the masts.
